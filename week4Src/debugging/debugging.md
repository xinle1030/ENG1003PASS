## What is debugging?

- Process of **systematically removing errors or bugs** from the logic and code of a programme. 
- Debugging usually involves **understanding the intended correct behaviour of the running programme** and 
                             **verifying if the actual behaviour diverges from the intended behaviour**
- When debugging, it can be useful to draw out a tree diagram as debugging usually involves data structures like for loops, if statements etc, and figure out why something is not working.
